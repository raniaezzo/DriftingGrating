function s=spike(alpha, r, c)%% SPIKE - 	creates a spike image, an array in which the%			value is inversely proportional to the distance%			from the center.  % % usage:%     S = SPIKE(ALPHA, R, C) produces an RxC array, the value%                           of which falls off as 1/(d^ALPHA) where d is%                           the euclidean distance from the array center.%     %     Useful for making 1/f^alpha noise images.%     % See also:  oneoverf(), spike3d(), oneoverf3d()% % Lawrence K.
